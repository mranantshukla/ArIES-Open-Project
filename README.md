# Aries Project Final

This repository contains the final implementation of the Aries Project. It includes a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the functionality and usage of advanced deep learning and visualization tools.

## Project Overview
The project leverages TensorFlow's VGG19 for neural style transfer and includes interactive widgets for enhanced usability.

## Files and Structure
- **src/**: Contains the main Jupyter Notebook and supporting scripts.
- **data/**: Placeholder for datasets (not included in the repository).
- **docs/**: Documentation files for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook src/AnantShukla_AriesProjectFinal.ipynb
    ```

## Usage
The notebook demonstrates:
- Neural style transfer using VGG19.
- Visualization of results using matplotlib.
- Interactive UI using ipywidgets.
